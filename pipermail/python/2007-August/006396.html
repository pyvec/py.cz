Summary:
Keywords:
 
 
Something mildly unusual is happening. Nobody has been getting at me for the
last couple of weeks. Best of all, about three weeks ago I bought a video
recorder to try to get some evidence from the News etc, and despite having
watched Martyn Lewis, Michael Buerk and the whole lot of them, not one of them
has said anything to me in the last three weeks. And I have been listening to
and recording Capital, with no ill effect. All in all, I am being
comprehensively ignored.
 
Of course, I should have video-taped the news programmes back in 1990/91/92
(and even 93) when it was still all going on. Anthony Johnsson (casually
name-drop to stick the knife in) will tell you how intelligent a person I am,
yet I didn't have the good sense to record the programmes at the time, and it's
a bit late now.
 
Today another avenue of exploration closed when my second summons against the
BBC was struck out (basically through lack of evidence), and an order was made
by the district judge saying that I could not sue John Birt again without the
express permission of the court. She explained that this was for my own good,
to save me the summons fees. Costs were not awarded though (the BBC didn't even
really seek costs), and I am free to sue anyone else I take a shine to.
..................................................................
It is not that you are being ignored.... it is just that as your mental
health improves, so your paranoia eases.

OR...

The dark forces are gathering strength for the final battle with you... 


Seriously though, it's nice to see you back - cos as long as they are
persecuting you, I can relax knowing they haven't got time to bother me!

[unreasonable optimism snipped]
 
Well, that didn't last very long, did it?
 
Capital Radio this evening approx 8.35pm, Neil Long's programme a few moments
after I switched to it (I am listening to it as I type this). The following
spouted from his mouth;
 
&quot;want to see Jacko in town? what a gig it's going to be, that guy is amazing,
and PSYCHOTIC, but amazing on stage, 0171-4200958, on stage he's a MADMAN but
he's wonderful&quot;
 
God, I am so tired of this. It's been going on for seven years. When's it going
to stop?

I have the above extract on tape. When I get around to it I will post it, and
the Hepworth snippet, as audio files on the website. Of course, all the
doubting Thomases and Smids can carry on doubting, because the mere fact that
moments after switching on the DJ starts talking about &quot;psychotic&quot;, that's not
proof is it?
 
I wrote an aggrieved letter to Chris Tarrant at Capital and sent it off today,
copied to Richard Park, Group Director of Programmes. I suppose they'll just
lie as usual. Bastards, basically.

The solution is surely to not have a TV, video, radio or telephone in 
the house, Mike. That way they can't be used to watch you.

No. I tried that strategy in 1990/91 when I sold my television and stopped
listening to the radio. It didn't work because they got at me through
co-workers and eventually the general public.
 
The solution is to gather evidence by recording everything, and then complain
or sue if possible. I wish I'd recorded it all five or six years ago, then I
might be more successful in a legal action now.
..................................................................
Did anyone else watch the X-Files on Sky last night (Sunday 13th April) and
recognise Mike's symptons in the chap with the tattoo?  It was quite
interesting to see someone responding in precisely the same way, picking up
on individual words and phrases in ordinary sentences and applying parts to
themselves as though they were intended.  

Not a pleasant ending though.  You take care, Mike, and keep taking the
medication.  uk.misc just wouldn't be the same without you now.

</I>
No, it isn't, but you knew that anyway.

Mike, how is it that you think that this can't be a coincidence because
it happened 'moments' after you switched on the radio? Haven't you just
told us that you haven't heard a thing for two weeks? Going two weeks
watching TV &amp; listening to the radio without a reference to 'mad', 'crazy'
or 'loony' is quite an acheivement, especially given the trashy radio you
seem to prefer.

I've just spent a lot of the weekend trying to keep a manic depressive
under control, so that she doesn't have to go back into hospital and
lose the last few months' memories to ECT. One thing I've noticed is
that manic depressives almost seek to foster their fantasies, they
enjoy the control and the high. You seem to be the same - you refuse
to answer the points put to you that explain away what you call persecution
totally - do you have the courage of your convictions to reply to this?
Or do you enjoy the attention your illness brings you?

Do please tell the *truth*.  It has been longer than *2* weeks as I'm sure
you have noticed, hasn't it ?

Well I claim responsibility for the absence of persecution.  When I rang
John Major's personal private secretary, not the personal political one or
any of the others in the same office, and I said you would vote for the
Conservative Party at the General Election the secretary said Johnny would
be so happy and as a sign of gratitude he rang-up the Head of MI5 and told
them to save money for tax cuts by abandoning forthwith their campaign
against you.  Consequently MI5 and MI6 have been able to redeploy urgently
needed resources (i.e. manpower and telecoms interceptions) against an
international band of (*****censored*****).

On behalf of the law-abiding and decent citizens in the British islands, I
would like to sincerely thank you for your invaluable contribution to
crime fighting by your instrumental achievement in releasing badly needed
and very scarce MI5 and MI6 resources.

Many thanks,

Please don't forget it is National Election time and the news broadcasts
at 21:00 on BBC1 are preoccupied with British politics.

</I>
Any particular date in mind ?  I have a few in the library.  You can also
purchase copies from the BBC on 0181-743 8000 (central switchboard).

</I>
Perhaps it is for the best.  Now that it is all over, you can return to
Canada.  Did you manage to get your Canadian citizenship ?   What did your
contracts at MI5 say about you becoming Canadian ?   You never did mention
the name of your MI5 liaison officer nor of any of the others.

That's true.  But as it is now all over there is no need to worry about
the past.  MI5 said your file has been removed from the Registry and put
in a burn-bag so there is nothing left for anyone ever to find.

By the way, what was the URL of your famous Corley web site ?

I have to admit that it is actually mildly amusing to have newsreaders watching
you, although it is tiresome after a bit. I am currently in an interesting
situation, because after my lawsuits against them I think the BBC newscasters
have stopped watching me entirely; I also think that ITN, in particular John
Suchet, *are* still watching but they're being subtle about it (his blink
pattern followed mine).

Being called nasty words is quite horrible though, and seems gratuitous; what
do they gain by it, except to exercise their sadism?

You have. They're not pleasant atmospheres, especially the secure wings,
which have more in common with prisons ('airlock' doors, list of 'banned'
articles, continuous observation). They have to be that way, unfortunately.
