<PRE>Victor Lewis-Smith has broken the silence in his TV review column &quot;Goon and 
best forgotten&quot; in the Evening Standard (on Thursday 8/May). He said, &quot;If I 
sound paranoid, that's probably because I once worked there. Eventually, I had 
to leave because they were all trying to kill me but, for sheer pathological 
hatred of the Corporation, I couldn't hold a candle to Spike Milligan&quot;.

I take this to be about me, because recently I wrote to both the BBC and 
Capital Radio, saying &quot;I believe the current purpose of the harassment is to 
force me to kill myself to prevent the harassers, yourselves included, from 
being brought to justice, and last year there were several incidents of people 
shouting 'suicide' at me, which would appear to corroborate that view.&quot; I think 
VLS's words about the BBC &quot;all trying to kill me&quot; shows he has seen or heard of 
what I sent to the BBC or Capital.

Nasty eh? I believe that VLS or his mates read this newsgroup. I wonder how he 
would explain his article?

Dear Mike,
 
Victor's not writing about you.
 
Yours,
 
John Hayward-Warburton
Victor's Webmaster

For some reason, I don't quite believe you. It's just too close a match.

Erm, Mike, I'm a bit of a fan of Victor Lewis-Smith, ever since his days
of &quot;BuyGones&quot;. I must admit, he often likes to play the flawed lunatic
evil nasty person. He's been doing it for years, with prank calls, far
before your illness. Its his act. He wouldn't be VLS without it.

He doesn't like the &quot;Goons&quot; either. It isn't about you.

&gt;<i>I take this to be about me, because recently I wrote to both the BBC and

I don't think Victor Lewis-Smith has worked for the BBC (or Capital) for
several years (1994 was the last time...), so the connection, is paranoia 
here. 

Personally, I believe VLS as a person of reasonable integrity, who wouldn't
give a fuck about you...

&gt;<i>Nasty eh? I believe that VLS or his mates read this newsgroup. I wonder how he 
</I>&gt;<i>would explain his article?
</I>
Keep up the medication, not as many people read this newsgroup as you think,
even though you are now incorporating that into your illness.

Victor? Are you there?
