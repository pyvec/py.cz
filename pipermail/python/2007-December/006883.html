</I>&gt;<i> MI5 Persecution Update: Friday 11 June, 1999
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Harassment in a pub in Clapham, Tuesday lunchtime
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once a month, or once every other month, I meet a Polish friends of mine
</I>&gt;<i> who lives in Clapham North, and sometimes we go to a particular pub near
</I>&gt;<i> where he lives. The last time was some two months ago; I did not have my
</I>&gt;<i> minidisc-walkman with me, and consequently was seriously harassed by
</I>&gt;<i> people MI5 had instructed to harass me, in the pub.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This Tuesday, 8 June 1999, we again went to the same pub for a pre-meal
</I>&gt;<i> drink. This time I did have my minidisc-walkman with me. As you can guess,
</I>&gt;<i> we were followed into the pub by a couple of young people (Im getting
</I>&gt;<i> older and older - isnt it funny how the MI5 agents all look young these
</I>&gt;<i> days?). They started talking about my situation, in particular some travel
</I>&gt;<i> I had booked the previous day. Unfortunately, they were talking fairly
</I>&gt;<i> quietly, and my minidisc didnt pick up their speech.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MI5s schizophrenic reasoning is that simultaneously I am very important
</I>&gt;<i> and worthy of their acts of persecution, and I am also totally unimportant
</I>&gt;<i> and their abuse of me &quot;doesnt matter&quot;. Perhaps they should test their
</I>&gt;<i> agents and managers for obsessive personalities or psychotic features in
</I>&gt;<i> the same way as employees are drug-tested. MI5 might lose their &quot;worst
</I>&gt;<i> cases&quot; employees if some psychological testing were applied to their
</I>&gt;<i> recruitment procedure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Toothless Watchdogs. What a Surprise.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Recently I have been engaging in communications with two watchdogs, the
</I>&gt;<i> Security Service Tribunal which deals with complaints against the security
</I>&gt;<i> service (and always clears MI5 of any wrongdoing), and the Data Protection
</I>&gt;<i> Registrar, which is mandated to investigate misuse of personal data held
</I>&gt;<i> on computer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a letter to Nick Brooks, Security Service Tribunal secretary, dated 20
</I>&gt;<i> April, I asked him if the Tribunal, as an allegedly independent body, had
</I>&gt;<i> the means to investigate complaints against MI5 other than asking MI5 to
</I>&gt;<i> themselves investigate complaints. To my disappointment, his reply two
</I>&gt;<i> weeks later answered the question only indirectly, in the
</I>&gt;<i> negative. Whatever the reader might think of the merits of the case I have
</I>&gt;<i> been putting before you in faxed articles this last year and half, you
</I>&gt;<i> will surely recognise that it is a significant anomaly for the Tribunal to
</I>&gt;<i> have no independent means of investigating complaints, particularly given
</I>&gt;<i> the view expressed even by previous home secretaries that the security
</I>&gt;<i> services are untrustworthy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MI5 Persecution: No Justice for the Victims of MI5
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a previous article I detailed the similarities between the current MI5
</I>&gt;<i> Persecution in England, and other historical instances of similar
</I>&gt;<i> persecution, notably that by the Nazi Germans in the thirties and
</I>&gt;<i> forties. The Germans persecuted first the mentally ill, the epileptics and
</I>&gt;<i> those suffering from schizophrenia, then moved on to racial groups; in
</I>&gt;<i> todays Britain the persecution is again directed at those with mental
</I>&gt;<i> illness, which the British in their cowardice find easier than taking on
</I>&gt;<i> racial groups as the Germans did. But just as in Thirties Germany there
</I>&gt;<i> was no recourse against a malign and omnipotent state, so the MI5 Secret
</I>&gt;<i> Police in the modern British Fascist State allow no justice for their
</I>&gt;<i> victims.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No Recourse Against the Security Services Illegal Harassment
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It has become apparent to me over the last nine years just how loaded the
</I>&gt;<i> dice are in todays Britain, a fundamentally fascist country which
</I>&gt;<i> masquerades as a democracy. Britain is a democracy in name only; the
</I>&gt;<i> Establishment, the defence and MI5 secret police are always there,
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of which party has been voted into power most recently - and
</I>&gt;<i> from &quot;New Labours&quot; conduct in office one finds it difficult to tell them
</I>&gt;<i> apart from Old Tories, in their crackdowns on the sick and vulnerable in
</I>&gt;<i> society.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In thirties Germany the victims of the Nazi regime had no legal recourse
</I>&gt;<i> against their State oppressors; and in todays Fascist British state, the
</I>&gt;<i> victims of the Establishment and its MI5 Secret Police similarly have no
</I>&gt;<i> recourse against the illegal state-funded and organised oppression. There
</I>&gt;<i> is supposed to be a mechanism for dealing with MI5 crimes, in the shape of
</I>&gt;<i> the Security Service Tribunal and Commissioner; yet these have never found
</I>&gt;<i> favour of a plaintiff. One might as well ask the Nazi SS to investigate
</I>&gt;<i> crimes against epileptics or Jews as ask the Security Service Tribunal to
</I>&gt;<i> investigate MI5 crimes against British citizens; it is quite obvious what
</I>&gt;<i> the answer is going to be, regardless of what you say to them, and what
</I>&gt;<i> evidence you provide. The Tribunal and Commissioner are a mere formality,
</I>&gt;<i> a whitewashing body to give the Secret Services a veneer beneath which
</I>&gt;<i> they hide their shabby criminality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Institutional Racism&quot; and Bigotry in the Metropolitan Police
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The recent inquiry into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence found clear
</I>&gt;<i> evidence of systematic and deliberate racism in the Metropolitan Police,
</I>&gt;<i> which cannot have surprised anyone. Commissioner Sir Paul Condon accepted
</I>&gt;<i> a somewhat lukewarm definition of institutional racism as being
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;unconscious&quot;. In truth, and this truth must surely be obvious to anyone
</I>&gt;<i> who has any familiarity or encountered the great British police, the Met
</I>&gt;<i> has not just &quot;unconscious&quot; racism, but very clearly &quot;conscious&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> deliberate racism, of the kind that would have done Thirties Germans
</I>&gt;<i> proud. And it is a bastion of such open racism - when many other parts of
</I>&gt;<i> society are learning to live in a multicultural environment, the Met is
</I>&gt;<i> still living in the past in its attitude to the minorities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But in addition to the systematic racism confirmed by the Lawrence
</I>&gt;<i> inquiry, there is also something much more relevant to this case, which is
</I>&gt;<i> systematic police bigotry against the physically and mentally disabled,
</I>&gt;<i> which I personally have experienced in my dealings with the police over
</I>&gt;<i> the years. You cannot expect equal treatment if you are mentally
</I>&gt;<i> disabled. I tried to make a complaint to the police in 1995 about the
</I>&gt;<i> harassment I had been subjected to for several years. As soon as they
</I>&gt;<i> found out I had mental illness, they refused to even talk to me. I tried
</I>&gt;<i> again in March 1999; the police made various threats to me, while ranting
</I>&gt;<i> about &quot;your paranoid rubbish&quot; in reference to the complaints expressed to
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The police refusal to do the job they are employed and paid to do is
</I>&gt;<i> extremely serious, particularly as this case is highly important, indeed
</I>&gt;<i> key to the whole issue of British self-perception at the end of the 20th
</I>&gt;<i> century and the beginning of the 21st century. Britain has lost much in
</I>&gt;<i> the last fifty years - it has lost an empire, it has lost its self-respect
</I>&gt;<i> and its identity as a people. If the MI5 persecution finally makes it into
</I>&gt;<i> the light and the Security Services are seen for the rather cheap bullies
</I>&gt;<i> their behaviour indicates, it will have a massive and harmful effect on
</I>&gt;<i> British self-perception in the new century.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Security Service Tribunal  - Blatant Whitewashing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few weeks ago I spoke on the phone to Nick Brooks, the Secretary of the
</I>&gt;<i> Security Service Tribunal, which is supposed to deal with cases of MI5
</I>&gt;<i> transgression. I asked him if the Tribunal had ever found in favour of a
</I>&gt;<i> plaintiff and against the Security Service. He answered that as far as he
</I>&gt;<i> knew, it had not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also asked Mr Brooks if the Tribunal had any means of investigating
</I>&gt;<i> allegations of criminal activity by MI5, other than asking MI5 themselves
</I>&gt;<i> if they had engaged in such activity. His rather circuitous written reply
</I>&gt;<i> states that the 1989 Security Service Act provides that &quot;it shall be the
</I>&gt;<i> duty of every member of the Service to disclose or give to the Tribunal
</I>&gt;<i> such documents or information as they may require for the purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> enabling them to carry out their functions under this Act&quot;. Which is a
</I>&gt;<i> very round-about way of saying - &quot;No&quot; - the Tribunal has no way of
</I>&gt;<i> investigating MI5 crimes - None At All.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Setting up the S.S. Tribunal, and creating a Security Service
</I>&gt;<i> Commissioner, was really an act of falsehood by the government. It is
</I>&gt;<i> generally recognised that MI5 are out of reach of the normal criminal
</I>&gt;<i> justice system - the police, as we have seen, have no intesot answer to
</I>&gt;<i> the government; in a previous article I quoted Roy Jenkins speaking of &quot;a
</I>&gt;<i> secretive atmosphere.... secretive vis-a-vis the government as well as
</I>&gt;<i> [enemies]&quot;, and a &quot;lack of frankness&quot; from MI5.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the government wanted to, it could reform the secret services and
</I>&gt;<i> ensure they acted in conformance with the laws which have been enacted for
</I>&gt;<i> them in the last ten years. But apparently the present government does not
</I>&gt;<i> see any need to ensure security service compliance with the law. As noted
</I>&gt;<i> above, the regulatory machinery for MI5 is deliberately weak; the Tribunal
</I>&gt;<i> has no independent means of investigation, and it is simply a waste of
</I>&gt;<i> time complaining to the Tribunal or Commissioner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Every so often, fresh revelations come to light of secret service
</I>&gt;<i> transgressions. We have heard from Shayler that MI5 bugged Jack Straw and
</I>&gt;<i> Peter Mandelson; we have heard from Peter Wright that MI5 plotted to see
</I>&gt;<i> Wilson ejected from office; yet so closed is the system of government that
</I>&gt;<i> the law is never enforced against MI5 when they &quot;bug and burgle&quot; everyone
</I>&gt;<i> from politicians to ordinary citizens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No Justice from the Legal System, either
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Britain has a civil and criminal justice system which effectively limits
</I>&gt;<i> many complaints from being heard. For a civil complaint to be brought
</I>&gt;<i> before a court, you need a solicitor willing to act on your
</I>&gt;<i> behalf. Supposedly it is possible to represent yourself as a
</I>&gt;<i> Litigant-in-Pthe basis of being &quot;frivolous and vexatious&quot; or &quot;disclosing
</I>&gt;<i> no cause for action in law&quot;. This is exactly what happened to me in 1997
</I>&gt;<i> when I twice tried to take the BBC to court for spying on me in my living
</I>&gt;<i> room at home; my case was twice struck out, and on the second occasion an
</I>&gt;<i> order was made against me that I could not bring further civil litigation
</I>&gt;<i> against the BBC without leave of the court.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As the reader can guess it is quite impossible for a person with
</I>&gt;<i> schizophrenia, who complains about the secret services and media
</I>&gt;<i> interfering in his life, to find a solicitor willing to represent him in
</I>&gt;<i> legal action against the persecutors. I have quite a lot of evidence of
</I>&gt;<i> the continuing persecution which I have posted on the website, even if the
</I>&gt;<i> evidence is quite tentative and perhaps open to varying
</I>&gt;<i> interpretations. But I have tried several firms of solicitors; some of
</I>&gt;<i> them have acted unprofessionally and abused me; all of them have refused
</I>&gt;<i> to represent me. My psychiatrist gave me the name of the firm of Bindman
</I>&gt;<i> and Partners in central London, and I have approached them twice. On each
</I>&gt;<i> occasion they refused to accept my instructions. Plainly the problem with
</I>&gt;<i> Bindmans, which they have admitted, is their bigotry against mentally
</I>&gt;<i> disabled people; yet this is not just something that is wrong with
</I>&gt;<i> Bindmans, it is something that is wrong with the legal system as a whole,
</I>&gt;<i> since the legal system necessitates finding a solicitor willing to
</I>&gt;<i> represent you in order to bring a case to court, but it does not have a
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism for providing a lawyer in the case where no solicitor is willing
</I>&gt;<i> to take on your case. So the British legal system is such as to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> cases such as mine from ever receiving an airing in a court.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So much for the civil courts. But the criminal justice system is no
</I>&gt;<i> better. Two years ago the Protection from Harassment Act came into
</I>&gt;<i> force. But again, while the Act is all very well on paper, in practice it
</I>&gt;<i> is unenforceable in my case, since it would require Police action to see
</I>&gt;<i> the law implemented, and if the police cannot even be trusted to conduct a
</I>&gt;<i> murder investigation competently (in the Lawrence case), then what chance
</I>&gt;<i> is there of their investigating complaints against the Security
</I>&gt;<i> Service? Of course, it would be possible for me to personally issue
</I>&gt;<i> proceedings through a private prosecution either against MI5 themselves,
</I>&gt;<i> or against one or more of their media tools; but here we see the same
</I>&gt;<i> problems as with the civil courts, because first of all I would have to
</I>&gt;<i> find a lawyer willing to act on my behalf. Litigants-in-person do exist in
</I>&gt;<i> the criminal courts, but the Attorney General can bring such a prosecution
</I>&gt;<i> to an end by taking it over and entering a plea of &quot;nolle prossequi&quot;; and
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that if I were to bring a private prosecution against either MI5
</I>&gt;<i> or one of their media tools, then this is exactly what would happen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So much for British justice. But if anything the wrongs that have been
</I>&gt;<i> perpetrated on me by the British justice system are quite mild to what
</I>&gt;<i> others have suffered. Others have been wrongly convicted based on police
</I>&gt;<i> evasions and lies, and spent many years in jail based on false charges. I
</I>&gt;<i> should count myself lucky that despite the best efforts of the MI5 secret
</I>&gt;<i> police, I have not acquired any criminal charges or convictions; which
</I>&gt;<i> shows that for all their resources and influence, and the clear
</I>&gt;<i> imperfections in the British legal system, there are still limits on how
</I>&gt;<i> much subversion MI5 can achieve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The latest in a long line of injustices
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A comment I heard during the recent scandal of the police mishandling of
</I>&gt;<i> the Lawrence murder investigation is that &quot;its not as if the police
</I>&gt;<i> themselves murdered him&quot;. This is not a particularly wise statement to
</I>&gt;<i> make about the case, since it could be argued that the four alleged
</I>&gt;<i> murderers were aided in their crime by the expectation that the police
</I>&gt;<i> would deliberately botch the investigation - which of course is exactly
</I>&gt;<i> what the police did.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But in my case, this would be a completely inaccurate thing to say - since
</I>&gt;<i> the MI5 secret-police have expressly been trying to nine years now to see
</I>&gt;<i> an end put to my life, either by having me incarcerated and my liberty
</I>&gt;<i> ended, or by forcing self-termination on me. It is exactly as if the
</I>&gt;<i> secret police &quot;themselves murdered [me]&quot;, since that is what their aim is
</I>&gt;<i> in their campaign against me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The public has heard of instances of police mishandling of cases, of
</I>&gt;<i> police manufacturing evidence, lying in court, extracting false
</I>&gt;<i> confessions to clear up crimes, et cetera. Various instances of
</I>&gt;<i> extra-legal activity by the secret services have also come to light in the
</I>&gt;<i> last few years. The unhappy truth is that what MI5 have been doing to me
</I>&gt;<i> for the last nine years is really nothing out of the ordinary for them. To
</I>&gt;<i> me it seems unbelievable that this sort of systematic campaign of
</I>&gt;<i> harassment, which thousands and thousands of people in this country and
</I>&gt;<i> abroad are well aware of, could exist for such a long period of time with
</I>&gt;<i> the media maintaining &quot;omerta&quot;. But my case is not the first such instance
</I>&gt;<i> of persecution by the &quot;British secret police&quot;, and judging by the lack of
</I>&gt;<i> any real controls on MI5, I very much doubt it will be the last.
