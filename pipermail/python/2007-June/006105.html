&lt;whopping great snip of 884 lines&gt;

corley, you puzzle me!

i've narrowed your possible motives down to one or more of the following:

1) you work on behalf of the british government with a hidden agenda of
furthering the largely right wing (most to hide) censorship brigade's
cause,  &quot;a drug-crazed psycho posting dangerous nonsense - how very very
sad - but in the public interest,we must act.&quot; draft internet (censorship)
bills rolling off hm govt's banders at this very moment, I don't doubt it!

2) you work for the daily mail which has started to feel the &quot;internet
pinch&quot; as it suddenly clicks in the chronically adled minds of yet more and
more of their readers - that shudder-inducing realisation that the entire
editorial staff at the mail are scaremongering, imbecilic, blood-leeching ,
totalitarian twats -  can any else sense a coordinated campaign on its way
??- &quot;Mail urges (their) government to act - internet safety endangered by
uncontrolled surfing lunatics - boys hands blown off by internet maniacs -

lee-potter (and english), take particular note.. (how ever you two common
********* managed to avoid encarceration for what was, quite
evidently,wilful contempt of court in the regina v taylforth &amp; knights
case, is frankly beyond me.. those dreaded and now all too familiar words
&quot;endemic corruption&quot; were muttered by at least one Q.C. 

&gt;<i>3) you (at least) believe there's (some) substance to your claim(s) and you

</I>&gt;<i>capable of distinguishing fantasy from reality.)
</I>
4) you (as an email address) are serving as some bizarre &quot;educational&quot;
programme orchestrated by the psychiatric industry - ever keen to justify
enforced electrical lobotomies, electroshock and dwugs .All poised for the
echo? - &quot;corley frigging well needs lobotomising&quot;

5) you're just clinically insane with absolutely no comprehension or
insight into the consequences you will possibly face as a result of
repeatedly posting what, certainly on the face of it, looks like complete
and utter bullshit.

6) you're some weirdo prankster(s) - probably a group of student
psychiatrists having a cheap crack whilst high as kites on pilfered
dihydrocodeine.

7) You are infact working for the ss yourself, gauging public awareness of
the extent and methods of bugging - infinity transmitters, microwave
surveillance devices, satellite tracking equipment, 'chipping' of black
crims, say no more.

8) You're fuelling the central usenet administration committee, who, it is
believed, are keen to see the introduction of a wide-reaching framework of
self-created powers relating to posting cancellation. (see the 'son of
RFC1036')


my bet's on (5) - but just fuck off corley- irritate the lard-arsed canucks
instead. The cia's financing of &quot;professor&quot; cameron's brain-washing
experiments in montreal.. would be a good starting point ... or perhaps
&quot;professor&quot; watts and his widely admired masterful double eye-jabbing trick
- a couple of wallops with an icepick. such a waste of perfectly edible 
four year old hispanics !!!!.. Perhaps the old marylebone rd posse could
fill us in with a few more facts on this one...?? You are all on the .net
now ?????  A very warm welcome :-) ... christmas rapidly approaching..

Actually, upon thinking about Mike's story it reminds me of someone I 
heard about who suffered from a persecution copmlex. He was an immigrant 
from some Eastern Bloc country who believed that 30 years after he 
emigrated the KGB were still after him. He would blame them if he 
had difficulty unlocking his car for instance (he reckoned they were 
putting something into the locks!).

Something is very wrong, probably in Mike's head but what the hell, 
loonies make life more fun!

&gt;<i>Something is very wrong, probably in Mike's head but what the hell,

</I>
Something is very wrong when the security services abandon their usual
target of politicians and the well-known, to pursue the hitherto unknown
nonentities such as myself.

&gt;<i>corley, you puzzle me!
</I>
Why? Because of my pathological truthfulness?

&gt;<i>3) you (at least) believe there's (some) substance to your claim(s) and you
</I>&gt;<i>have a genuine axe to grind. If so, bloody well go for it, but scrape the
</I>&gt;<i>heavy layer of steaming dung off the top (that's assuming you're even
</I>&gt;<i>capable of distinguishing fantasy from reality.)
</I>
Bloody well go for it I will.

I think the &quot;standard spiel&quot; is quite studded with facts actually.
There's plenty of &quot;meat&quot; there if the appropriate people can be motivated
to get their act together and pursue the case.

&gt;<i>my bet's on (5) - but just fuck off corley- irritate the lard-arsed canucks
</I>&gt;<i>instead. The cia's financing of &quot;professor&quot; cameron's brain-washing
</I>
the lard-arsed canucks (?) are irritating me, but you don't want to hear
about that

&gt;<i>business booming?? Do we all get a look in at flotation ??!!
