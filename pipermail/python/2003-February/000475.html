<PRE>Dear SIR, 
 
I am Mr. John Coleman and my sister is Miss Rose Coleman, we are the 
children of late Chief Paul Coleman from Sierra Leone. I am writing you in 
absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash 
of twenty one Million Dollars ($21,000.000.00) now in the custody of a 
private Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk 
boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a 
matter of fact the company does not know the content as money, although my 
father made 
them to under stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner. 
 
 Source of the money: 
 
 My late father Chief Paul Coleman , a native of Mende District in the 
Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone 
Mining 
co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money was 
the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales. 
 
Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul 
Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that 
almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of 
the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father 
had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother, 
my little sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan Cote d' Ivoire with 
the CERTIFICATE OFDEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through 
the aid of U.N 
evacuation team. 
 
During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of 
Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone 
mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father 
including other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the 
rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian 
Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. 
 
As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's 
involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The 
untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related 
complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have 
spent a lot of money 
on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone 
in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any 
relation, 
we are nowlike refugees and orphans. 
 
Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firm To 
this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways. 
 
 1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security 
 Firm as our beneficiary 
 
 2. to transfer this money (USD$21M) in your name to your country 
 
 3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our 
behalf in your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager 
 
 
For your assistance, I have agreed with my younger sister that 15% of the 
total amount will be for your effort and another 5 % to cover all the 
expenses that may incur during the business transaction, Last, I urge you 
to keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one knows our where 
about. 
 
Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name, address 
and Tel/ Fax numbers, to me via my private email address as indicated 
bellow, this is for security reasons as i will only be accessing my 
private email earnestly awaiting your response. 
 
 
Thanks. 
 
May God bless you as you assist us. 
 
Mr. JOHN COLEMAN.
